# Free Spin Decay

## Introduction
Free spin decay, also known as free induction decay (FID), is a phenomenon observed in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). It refers to the signal generated by the precession of nuclear spins around an external magnetic field after the removal of a radiofrequency pulse.

## What is Free Spin Decay?
When a sample is placed in a strong magnetic field, the nuclear spins align with the field. A radiofrequency pulse is then applied to perturb this alignment, causing the spins to precess around the magnetic field. Once the pulse is turned off, the spins gradually return to their equilibrium state, emitting a signal as they do so. This emitted signal is the free spin decay.

Understanding free spin decay is crucial as it serves as a stepping stone to more complex phenomena such as the spin echo. The spin echo technique builds upon the principles of free spin decay to refocus the dephasing spins, allowing for more precise measurements of relaxation times and molecular interactions.

## What Are We Trying to Measure?
In free spin decay, we are primarily interested in measuring the following:

1. **Signal Amplitude**: The strength of the emitted signal, which can provide information about the number of nuclei contributing to the signal.
2. **Decay Time (T2)**: The time it takes for the signal to decay, which is related to the interactions between spins and can provide insights into the molecular environment.
3. **Frequency**: The frequency of the precession, which is related to the magnetic field strength and the type of nuclei being observed.

By analyzing these measurements, we can gain valuable information about the molecular structure, dynamics, and interactions within the sample.
