# Paramagnetic Experiment Documentation

## Overview
In this paramagnetic experiment, we aim to measure the drop in amplitude of the signal when a paramagnetic object is placed in the measuring coil. The experiment is designed to observe the changes in the electromagnetic properties of the coil when influenced by a paramagnetic material.

## Objective
The primary objective of this experiment is to quantify the change in signal amplitude caused by the introduction of a paramagnetic object into the measuring coil. This change in amplitude is indicative of the paramagnetic properties of the object being tested.

## Methodology
1. **Setup**: The measuring coil is set up and calibrated to ensure accurate readings.
2. **Baseline Measurement**: The initial amplitude of the signal is recorded without any paramagnetic object in the coil.
3. **Introduction of Paramagnetic Object**: A paramagnetic object is placed within the measuring coil.
4. **Measurement**: The amplitude of the signal is recorded with the paramagnetic object in place.
5. **Analysis**: The drop in amplitude is analyzed to determine the paramagnetic properties of the object.

## Measurement
- **Signal Amplitude**: The primary measurement in this experiment is the amplitude of the signal generated by the measuring coil.
- **Amplitude Drop**: The difference in signal amplitude before and after placing the paramagnetic object in the coil is calculated to assess the impact of the paramagnetic material.

This measurement is mainly a stepping stone to more advanced techniques such as free induction decay (FID) and eventually spin echo detection. These techniques allow for a deeper analysis of the material's properties and behavior under electromagnetic fields.
