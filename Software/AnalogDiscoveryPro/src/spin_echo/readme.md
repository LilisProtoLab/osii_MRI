# Spin Echo Experiment

## Introduction
The spin echo experiment is a fundamental technique in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). It is used to refocus dephasing spins, allowing for more precise measurements of relaxation times and molecular interactions.

## What is Spin Echo?
In a spin echo experiment, a sample is placed in a strong magnetic field, causing the nuclear spins to align with the field. A radiofrequency pulse is applied to perturb this alignment, causing the spins to precess around the magnetic field. After a certain time, a second pulse is applied to refocus the dephasing spins, creating an echo signal. This echo signal provides valuable information about the sample's properties.

## What Are We Trying to Measure?
In the spin echo experiment, we are primarily interested in measuring the following:

1. **Echo Amplitude**: The strength of the echo signal, which can provide information about the number of nuclei contributing to the signal.
3. **Frequency**: The frequency of the precession, which is related to the magnetic field strength and the type of nuclei being observed.

By analyzing these measurements, we can gain valuable information about the molecular structure, dynamics, and interactions within the sample.

## Technical Limitations
The current detection system has several technical limitations that have not yet been fully tested or proven. These include issues with coil impedance matching, mixers, and RF amplifiers. As a result, we are currently unable to measure a spin echo accurately. These limitations affect the system's ability to generate and detect the necessary radiofrequency pulses with the required precision, leading to unreliable measurements and an inability to obtain a clear spin echo signal.
Additionally, the internal clock of the detection system has shown inconsistencies, which further complicates the timing and synchronization required for accurate spin echo measurements. This issue contributes to the overall unreliability of the system and hinders our ability to obtain precise and repeatable results.
