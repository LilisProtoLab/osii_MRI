# OSII Mini at Lili's Proto Lab

Documentation for building the open source ultra low-field MRI at Utrecht University

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is one of the most powerful and versatile non-invasive medical imaging devices. 
Ultra low-field MRI scanners such as __OSII One__ have recently reached the maturity level of [attempting eligibility for standardization and medical certification](https://www.opensourceimaging.org/). 
These open source projects has pooled the knowledge and experience of many experts and can be built and maintained for a fraction of the price of current instruments. 
Several groups worldwide have succeeded in replicating this device or build similar design. 

This project is an initiative of the [Lili's Proto Lab](https://www.uu.nl/lpl) with the aim of preparing a hands-on workshop for student teams to replicated an OSII-inspired functioning MRI.
Student teams can be a great force in progressing this field. 
Collectively, they can enhance the accuracy and utility of open-source MRI devices through rigorous calibration procedures, iterative testing, and collaboration with experts in both engineering and medical fields.  

## MRI Resources
More information about MRIs and their operations can be found below:
+ [OSI<sup>2</sup> Repository:](https://gitlab.com/osii) Here you can find additional information about the original OSI<sup>2</sup> ONE
+ [Integrated System Design:](/Docs/System_Integration_Singapore_LF_MRI.pdf) More information about integrating RF and gradient system design


## Main features

We are replicating the OSII mini design by Dr. Joshua Harper from [Sustainable MRI Lab](smrilab.com) which is based on the original work of Thomas O'Reilly and Andrew Webb at Leiden University.

+ __The Halbach magnet:__
	+ 120 mm inner diameter 
	+ DSV 100 x100 x100 mm
	+ 396 magnets 12x12x12 mm
	+ 50 mT
	+ around 1500 Euros for a completed magnet

## Build instructions

At this moment, we are adjusting and testing the magnet design. The build instructions will be posted in the [Build](./Build/) subfolder

## Outcomes

Our aim to be ready for a workshop on the third week of November 2024 in the Netherlands aimed specifically for student groups. 
This event will be organized as a satellite event with the OSII build workshop in Berlin, in which the OSII ONE engineers will present a new generation of their device. 

## Team

+ Project leads: Sanli Faez, Pauline Krijgsheld (Lili's Proto Lab)
+ Contributors (alphabetical order):
	+ Wilbert Bartels, Medical Imaging, UMC Utrecht

## Get involved

We don't accept pull request at this moment. Our goal is to open up for external contributions after the workshop in November 2024 

This is a bottom-up initiative and participation in the workshop is on a voluntary basis. If you share the vision and goals of this initiative, we welcome all your compassionate support. 

You can support this initiative by any or all these options:
-	Recommending this workshop to enthusiastic students* in your institute.
-	Providing support, mentorship and expert advice to students who participate.
-	Hosting student teams in your lab/institute after the workshop for enhancing their builds.
-	Contributing to the preparation of the workshop with time, funding, or student assistants.
-	Financial support for purchasing the build materials.

Please contatct Sanli, for any inquiries.
